# rMview: a fast live viewer for reMarkable

[![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bordaigorl/rmview/vnc/screenshot.png)][demo]


## Features

* Demo [:rocket: here][demo]
* Fast streaming of reMarkable's screen to a window in your computer
* UI for zooming, panning, rotating
* Pen tracking: a pointer follows the position of the pen when hovering on the reMarkable
* Clone a frame into separate window for reference
* Save screenshot as PNG

> :loudspeaker: **Volunteers needed**: if you have experience with producing binary bundles with pyQt, and feel like contributing to the project, drop me a line!

> :warning: **WARNING** :warning::
> rMview has only been tested with reMarkable 1.
> Support for reMarkable 2 may come once it gets wider diffusion.
> The [ssh branch][ssh-branch] should be compatible with the reMarkable 2.


## Installation

1. You will need [Python3][py3] on your computer.

   > :warning: Please make sure `pip` is pointing to the Python3 version if your system has Python2 as well.
   If not, use `pip3` instead of `pip` in what follows.

2. The easiest installation method is by using pip:

       pip install .

   which will install all required dependencies and install a new `rmview` command.
   Alternatively you may want to install the dependencies ([PyQt5][pyqt5], [Paramiko][paramiko], [Twisted][twisted]) with `pip` manually.


3. On the reMarkable itself you need to install [rM-vnc-server][vnc] and its dependency [mxc_epdc_fb_damage](https://github.com/peter-sa/mxc_epdc_fb_damage).
   Instructions can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/bordaigorl/rmview/wiki/How-to-run-the-VNC-based-version).
   This last step will be automated in the near future.

To run the tool after installation just run `rmview` from a console.

> :warning: **WARNING** :warning::
> If you use [Anaconda][anaconda], please install the dependencies via `conda` (and not `pip`).

Tested with Python 3.8.2, PyQt 5.14.2, MacOs 10.15.4, reMarkable firmware 2.1.1.3.

## Usage and configuration

You can invoke the program with

    rmview [config]

the optional `config` parameter is the filename of a json configuration file.
If the parameter is not found, the program will look for a `rmview.json` file in the current directory, or, if not found, for the path stored in the environment variable `RMVIEW_CONF`.
If none are found, or if the configuration is underspecified, the tool is going to prompt for address/password.

### Configuration files

The supported configuration settings are below.
Look in file `example.json` for an example configuration.
All the settings are optional.

| Setting key              | Values                                                                     | Default       |

| `ssh`                    | Connection parameters (see below)                                          | `{}`          |
| `orientation`            | `"landscape"`, `"portrait"`, `"auto"`                                      | `"landscape"` |
| `pen_size`               | diameter of pointer in px                                                  | `15`          |
| `pen_color`              | color of pointer and trail                                                 | `"red"`       |
| `pen_trail`              | persistence of trail in ms                                                 | `200`         |
| `background_color`       | color of window                                                            | `"white"`     |
| `hide_pen_on_press`      | if true, the pointer is hidden while writing                               | `true`        |
| `hide_pen_delay`	   | if > 0, the pointer is hidden if it was shown `hide_pen_delay` seconds ago | `-1`          |

Connection parameters are provided as a dictionary with the following keys (all optional):

| Parameter   | Values                                 | Comments                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `address`   | IP of remarkable                       | tool prompts for it if missing  |
| `username`  | username for ssh access on reMarkable  | default: `"root"`               |
| `key`       | Local path to key for ssh              | not needed if password provided |
| `password`  | Password provided by reMarkable        | not needed if key provided      |
| `timeout`   | connection timeout in seconds          | default: 1                      |


## To Do

 - [ ] Settings dialog
 - [ ] About dialog
 - [ ] Pause stream of screen/pen
 - [ ] Binary bundles for Window, Linux and MacOs (PyInstaller?)
 - [ ] Add interaction for Lamy button? (1 331 1 down, 1 331 0 up)
 - [ ] Remove dependency to Twisted in `vnc` branch


## Legacy reStreamer-like version

There are two versions of rMview, presenting the same interface but using different back-ends (thus requiring different setups on the reMarkable):

* The "VNC-based" version, in the [`vnc` branch][vnc-branch] (default)
* The "reStreamer-like" version, in the [`ssh` branch][ssh-branch]

In my tests, the VNC version is a clear winner.
The `ssh` branch of this repo hosts the reStreamer-like version for those who prefer it, but I am not planning to update it.
